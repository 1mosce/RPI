Hello,my name is Nickolay,and this is my take on the task!

//HOW TO RUN MY CODE//

There are two ways to do it:
1 - Go to https://awesome-hermann-3aac9a.netlify.app/

2 - Download project and run it through any IDE,run a localhost server

About the code itself:
-The work in general took me a couple of hours of time, and most of this time was spent on the implementation of convenient and efficient code, which allows you to use it in the future to create similar forms.
To be honest, the code is not perfect, and I understand that perfectly. But despite this, he perfectly fulfills the task assigned to me.In the design, I tried to bring more interactivity for the end user. Illumination of icons, small animations and a nice interface work perfectly together to make the user's eye happy.
All the colors in the SCSS file were specified as variables, therefore, if there is a need to change the color of a certain element, then it is enough just to change the value in the variable itself, and not look for the elements to which it is assigned
